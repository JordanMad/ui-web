## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Not sure about the production build if its going to build, so use only the dev environment.
Make sure to have node > 18

Due to time contraints I wasn't able to make validations
Only happy paths exists

Also the checkout page is not done

Future implementation:
Zod validaton of the inputs and requests.
Better split of the small components.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
